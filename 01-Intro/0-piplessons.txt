pip install Django
- The recommended way to install Django
- Django's page recommends a virtual installation, however

pip list
- Lists installed Python packages, including editables
- Packages listed in a case-insensitive sorted order
- Also lists version

pip install Django (We know you already ran this one. What information do you see returned in terminal after this command?)
- "Requirement already satisfied: Django in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages"
- "Requirement already satisfied: pytz in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from Django)"

pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?)
- According to Stack Overflow:
    freeze                      Output installed packages in requirements format.
    list                        List installed packages.
- When you are using a virtualenv, you can specify a requirements.txt file to install all the dependencies.

pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file?
- pip freeze outputted a file called requirements.txt into the directory
- Inside the file, the output of 'pip freeze' was printed
- According to pip documentation, each line of the requirements file indicates something to be installed
- It is a file meant to be read by pip to install specific versions

pip uninstall Django
- Uninstalled Django
- Prompted a y/n confirmation

pip show Django
- Did not do anything
- Since Django is no longer on the system

pip search Flask. This one might take a moment to execute.
- Listed out a lot of files, did take a while
- It is a command to search for a package that includes the word "Flask"
- "You should see an output with all packages containing the name 'Flask' and a description with that."
