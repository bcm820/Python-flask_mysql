1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

    SELECT SUM(billing.amount) as '2012-03_revenue'
    FROM billing
    WHERE billing.charged_datetime LIKE '2012-03%'


2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

    SELECT clients.client_id,
        SUM(billing.amount) as 'total_revenue_client2'
    FROM billing
        JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
    WHERE clients.client_id = 2
 

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

    SELECT clients.client_id, sites.site_id, sites.domain_name
    FROM sites
        JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    WHERE clients.client_id = 10


4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

    SELECT
        clients.client_id,
        COUNT(sites.site_id) as amt_of_websites,
        MONTHNAME(sites.created_datetime) AS month,
        YEAR(sites.created_datetime) AS year
    FROM clients
        JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    WHERE
        clients.client_id = 1 OR clients.client_id = 20
    GROUP BY sites.created_datetime
    ORDER BY sites.created_datetime


5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

    SELECT
        sites.domain_name AS website,
        COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS amt_of_leads,
        DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') AS date_generated
    FROM leads JOIN sites ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
    WHERE leads.registered_datetime
        BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-02-15'
    GROUP BY leads.leads_id


6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

    SELECT
        CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,
        COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS amt_of_leads
    FROM leads
        JOIN sites ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
        JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    WHERE leads.registered_datetime
        BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
    GROUP BY clients.client_id


7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

    SELECT
        CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,
        COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS amt_of_leads,
        MONTHNAME(leads.registered_datetime)
    FROM leads
        JOIN sites ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
        JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    WHERE leads.registered_datetime
        BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-06-31'
    GROUP BY leads.leads_id


8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.

    SELECT
        CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,
        sites.domain_name AS website,
        COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS amt_of_leads,
        DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') AS date_generated
    FROM leads
        JOIN sites ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
        JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    WHERE leads.registered_datetime
        BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
    GROUP BY sites.domain_name
    ORDER BY clients.client_id ASC


Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

    SELECT
        CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,
        sites.domain_name AS website,
        COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS amt_of_leads
    FROM leads
        JOIN sites ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
        JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    GROUP BY sites.domain_name
    ORDER BY clients.client_id ASC


9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

    SELECT
        CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,
        SUM(billing.amount) AS total_revenue,
        MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) AS month_charge,
        YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) AS year_charge
    FROM clients
        JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
    GROUP BY billing.charged_datetime
    ORDER BY clients.client_id ASC, billing.charged_datetime ASC


10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

    SELECT
        CONCAT_WS(' ', clients.first_name, clients.last_name) AS client_name,
        GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name) AS sites
    FROM clients
        JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    GROUP BY clients.client_id
    ORDER BY clients.client_id ASC
